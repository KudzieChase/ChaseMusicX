# Gallium Music Player: Codenamed ChaseMusicX ðŸŽ¼

## A material design music player written using Clean Architecture.

The app is heavily under development and contains a lot of bugs. I will be updating issues as I develop them.
The music player is heavily dependent on Android's media framework and will query music provided by MediaStore for now.

I am using Dagger2 for dependency injection [I may migrate to Hilt when Hilt is out of Beta] and Kotlin's Coroutines for background execution.

This readme will also be updated as time goes on but feel free to browse my code as well as read through it.
